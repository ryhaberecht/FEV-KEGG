    This class inherits from :class:`concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` and only replaces the worker function which pulls work items from the call_queue and reports their results back on the result_queue.
    A KeyboardInterrupt can be caught during execution of the work item, but not when the next work item is being pulled from the call_queue! A KeyboardInterrupt stack trace is printed and the process dies.
    This class catches a KeyboardInterrupt during call_queue-pulling and causes the current process (one within the pool) to sys.exit() immediately, without printing a KeyboardInterrupt stack trace.
    Per default, sys.exit() does not cause a stack trace print.
