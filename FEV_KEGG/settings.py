automaticallyStartProcessPool = True
"""
Whether a pool of processes should automatically spin up.

You will want this *False* if:

- you ``import FEV_KEGG`` inside a background thread or a child process *only*, because starting a process pool only works from within the main thread of the main process **OR**
- you already have other means of providing parallelism **OR**
- you want to save on the rather big overhead of spinning up, using, and tearing down processes. Especially when you ``import FEV_KEGG`` without actually using the process pool, e.g. when using something like Sphinx with autodoc.

If you do have this *False*, you will have to either:

- run :func:`FEV_KEGG.startProcessPool()`. You should do this as early as possible, because your whole main process will be copied, including all the RAM it hitherto occupied. Will only work within the main thread of the main process **OR**
- replace :attr:`FEV_KEGG.Util.Parallelism.processPool` with a :class:`concurrent.futures.Executor` of your choice, or else some functions will fail and raise an error, especially in :class:`FEV_KEGG.KEGG.Organism.Group`. The object may be a dummy, as long as it adheres to the interface and successfully works on tasks.

You will want this *True* if:

- you ``import FEV_KEGG`` in your main thread of the main process only **AND**
- you want to use functions utilising parallelism in the process pool, especially in :class:`FEV_KEGG.KEGG.Organism.Group` **AND**
- you rarely import without actually using the process pool, because spinning up and tearing down processes can take several seconds.
