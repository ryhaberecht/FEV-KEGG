core metabolism majority: 80%
neofunctionalisation majority: 0% (this means that gene duplication within a single organism is enough)

Proteobacteria:

core metabolism ECs: 226

"neofunctionalised" ECs: 79 (35%)
robust ECs: 42 (19%)
    of which are robust due to "neofunctionalised" ECs: 90%


All neofunctionalisations: 12012
