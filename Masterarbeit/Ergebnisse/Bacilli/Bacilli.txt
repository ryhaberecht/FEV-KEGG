core metabolism majority: 80%
neofunctionalisation majority: 0% (this means that gene duplication within a single organism is enough)

Bacilli: 321 organisms

core metabolism ECs: 185

"neofunctionalised" ECs: 39 (21%)
robust ECs: 32 (17%)
    of which are robust due to "neofunctionalised" ECs: 53%
