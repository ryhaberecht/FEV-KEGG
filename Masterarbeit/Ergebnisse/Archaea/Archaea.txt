core metabolism majority: 80%
neofunctionalisation majority: 0% (this means that gene duplication within a single organism is enough)

Archaea: 221 organisms

core metabolism ECs: 114

"neofunctionalised" ECs: 16 (14%)
robust ECs: 2 ( 2%)
    of which are robust due to "neofunctionalised" ECs: 100%
